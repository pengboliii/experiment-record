# PCI system---Absorption Measurement Setup 


## Abstract
1. We developed and tested an optical absorption measurement system based on the so-called Photo-thermal Common-path Interferometer(PCI) technique.
2. The sensitivity on sapphire bulks is better than 2 ppm/cm and the calibration is compliant with other laboratories.
3. We are now able to measure the absorption continuously along the depth of the sample and to make 3D absorption maps
4. We can measure varity size of sample and different material substrates and coatings.
5. We reach a sensitivity better than 2 ppm/cm.
6.
