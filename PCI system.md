# PCI system---Absorption Measurement Setup 


## Abstract
1. We developed and tested an optical absorption measurement system based on the so-called Photo-thermal Common-path Interferometer(PCI) technique. a highpower laser at 1064 nm periodically heats up the sample that we want to test; then a probe laser at 633 nm crosses the sample, and it is used to measure the absorption rate inside and on the surface of the sample. 
2. We take advantage of the thermal lens effect to measure the optical absoprtion. The sensitivity on sapphire bulks is better than 2 ppm/cm and the calibration is compliant with other laboratories. 
3. We are now able to measure the absorption continuously along the depth of the sample and to make 3D absorption maps, and varity size of samples.
