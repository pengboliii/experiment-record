# PCI system---Absorption Measurement Setup 


## Abstract
* We developed and tested an optical absorption measurement system based on the so-called Photo-thermal Common-path Interferometer(PCI) technique: a highpower laser at 1064 nm periodically heats up the sample that we want to test; then a probe laser at 633 nm crosses the sample, and it is used to measure the absorption rate inside and on the surface of the sample. By taking advantages of the thermal lens effect, We are able to measure the absorption continuously along the depth of the sample and to make 3D absorption maps. We can measure samples of several size, from 1 inch in diameter, to 22cm in diameter and 15cm in thickness, which corresponds to the KAGRA mirrors size, and different coatings including amorphous coatings and crystalline coatings.The sensitivity on sapphire bulks is better than 2 ppm/cm. As for the coating measurement, we reached a sensitivity of 0.03 ppm with the HeNe probe and 0.1 ppm with the infrared probe. This infrared probe's sensitivity is enough to measure the AlGaAs crystalline coatings which are expected to absorb less than 1 ppm.
