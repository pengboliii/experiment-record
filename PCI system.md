# PCI system---Absorption Measurement Setup 


## Abstract
    We developed and tested an optical absorption measurement system based on the so-called Photo-thermal Common-path Interferometer(PCI) technique: a high power laser at 1064 nm periodically heated up the samplewe want to test; then a probe laser at 633nm crossed the sample, and it is used to measure the absorption rate inside and on the surface of the sample.
