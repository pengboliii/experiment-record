# PCI system---Absorption Measurement Setup 


## Abstract
1. We developed and tested an optical absorption measurement system based on the so-called Photo-thermal Common-path Interferometer(PCI) technique。
2. We can measure varity size of sample and different material substrates and coatings.
3. We reach a sensitivity better than 2 ppm/cm.
4. We use the
