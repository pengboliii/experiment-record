# PCI system---Absorption Measurement Setup 


## Abstract
<br/>
We developed and tested an optical absorption measurement system based on the so-called Photo-thermal Common-path Interferometer(PCI) technique: a high power laser at 1064 nm periodically heated up the sample we want to test; then a probe laser at 633nm crossed the sample, and it is used to measure the absorption rate inside and on the surface of the sample.
## 1. Introduction
<br/>
The optical absorption of a material is the transformation of part of the incident optical power into heat. The way to measure absorption is to sense how much the temperature increase when a laser goes through the material. When the temperature change is small, of the order of few mK, a direct measurement with a thermometer might be inaccurate. In the case of optics, we can take advantage of the so-called
