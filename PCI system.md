# PCI system---Absorption Measurement Setup 


## Abstract
* We developed and tested an optical absorption measurement system based on the so-called Photo-thermal Common-path Interferometer(PCI) technique: a highpower laser at 1064 nm periodically heats up the sample that we want to test; then a probe laser at 633 nm crosses the sample, and it is used to measure the absorption rate inside and on the surface of the sample. 
* We take advantage of the thermal lens effect to measure the optical absoprtion and reached a sensitivity of 0.03 ppm with the HeNe probe, and sensitivity on sapphire bulks is better than 2 ppm/cm.  We are able to measure the absorption continuously along the depth of the sample and to make 3D absorption maps, and measure samples of several size, from 1 inch in diameter, to 22cm in diameter and 15cm in thickness, which corresponds to the KAGRA mirrors size.
