# Pound-Drever-Hall laser frequency stablilization
## 1.Intro
* The pdh technique is use for improving the laser frequency stablility.  
* In principle, a laser's frequency is measured with a F-P cavity and then feedback the result to the laser to supress the frequency fluctuation.
### Previous method for laser locking
We operate just to one side of the resonances, but near enough that some light get transmitted.  
Then a small change in laser frequency will produce a proportional change in the transimitted intensity.  
Measure that intensity and then feed it back to the laser to hold this intensity.
