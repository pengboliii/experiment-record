## Record from Nov. 6 to Nov. 14
### TAMA-size sample #1
* We finished the characterization of TAMA #1 last week with 5 different input polarization angle. And then start to measure the KAGRA-size unknown sample. But, since this sample is coated both side, to measure the polarization we have to increase the laser power which exceeded the measurable range of this setup. So we only did a polariztion distribution map of s and p and skip to another KAGRA-size sample, which has not been coated.
* And also we covered the OSTM_SK sample with the first contact in order to transport it to KAGRA.
### KAGRA-size Shinkosha sample #7
* We have already fully characterized this sample with 5 different input polarization angle.
* For the s- and p- polarization maps, it shows an apparent offset which mainly due to the birefringence effect.
* But for the other three mixtured maps, it is well matched with the incident polarization angle, which I don't know how to explain.
* And noted that, the laser seems to be very unstable at the AC output signal which either goes up or down everytime when I did the adjustment to the HWP
