## Reconfigure the polarization setup to PCI system
### setup
* remove QWP and HWP  
> using for changing the polarization of the laser
* remove ND filters  
> using for reducing the laser power to a acceptable level  
* remove the lense   
> using for focus the laser 
* add the photodiode  
> using for recieve the laser
* connect the cables for the high-powermeter and photodetector
* adjusting the image unit to a right position, 70mm 
* open the probe laser  

## Measure the absorption map of OSTM with ATC coating
* Using the calibration samples to get the R factor
* Change it to the OSTM sample to make a 2D scan
* Make the absorption map with the OSTM sample
