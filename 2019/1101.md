## Mixture polarization measurement
### First try
With the laser go through the center of the sample, I remeasured the Maximum and Minimum value of DC and AC and found it inconsistent with the results before. So I chosed the new value, then adjust the HWP to find the mixture sp polarization with a ratio one to one.  After doing that, I started the map.

#### Mistake
First, the value inconsistent is due to my misunderstand of the measurement, these four value should be measured without the sample.  
Second, for the mixture polarization, it should also be adjust without the sample.**Because we are measuring the birefringence effect of teh sapphire sample. For the sapphire sample, due to its inner structure, we consider it is not isotropic, and that's why it has birefringence. So in our case, to measure how it react to the mixture polarization, we need to first adjust the laser to a mixture state without the sample, then test the sample's behavior**

### Second try
After understanding the mistake, I remeasure the DC and AC value without the sample and get expected results. Then I change the HWP to have a one to one mixture polarization sp. With the sample move to the center again, I started the map.
