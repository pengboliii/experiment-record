## Reconfigured the setup to the Birefringence Measurement system
### Components
1. beam dump
2. ND filters
3. First PBS(with lower stage)
4. QWP & HWP
5. Foucing lens
6. Second PBS(with taller stage)
7 Two photodiode
### Cables
1. two signal input cables(connected with two photodiode)
2. S-polarization ouput with red cable (connected with s-pol photodiode)
3. P-polarization ouput with yellow cable (connected with p-pol photodiode)
4. Oscillator red cable(connected with one of the photodiode)
### Alignments & Calibration
1. Alignments 
2. Calibration
* using the QWP & HWP to seek for the s-pol and p-pol
* using the oscillator to minimize the x component of the photodiodes
